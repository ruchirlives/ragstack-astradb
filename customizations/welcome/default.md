### Generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of large language models like OpenAI GPT-4 with the ability to retrieve relevant information from external data sources. This chatbot demonstrates the potential of RAG by leveraging the advanced natural language processing capabilities of GPT-4 and the high-performance data storage and retrieval of DataStax Astra DB.

#### How RAG Works
When a user inputs a query, the chatbot first searches the connected Astra DB database for relevant information. The retrieved data is then used to augment the input query, providing additional context to the language model. GPT-4 processes this augmented query and generates a response that incorporates the retrieved information, resulting in more accurate and context-aware answers.

#### How to Use
To start using the chatbot, use the left side panel to browse or drag in a pdf(s), spreadsheet(s) exported as .csv or similar document, and click Upload document(s). Then, simply enter your query in the input field and press "Send." The chatbot will process your request and provide a response based on the information retrieved from Astra DB and the knowledge of the GPT-4 language model.

#### Important:
Please ensure that you do not share any confidential or personal data, or any information that you wouldn't want to release into the public domain. The chatbot is designed to provide general information and assistance, and it is not suitable for handling sensitive or private information.
