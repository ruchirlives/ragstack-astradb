####Generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of large language models like OpenAI GPT-4 with the ability to retrieve relevant information from external data sources. This chatbot demonstrates the potential of RAG by leveraging the advanced natural language processing capabilities of GPT-4 and the high-performance data storage and retrieval of DataStax Astra DB.

###How RAG Works
When a user inputs a query, the chatbot first searches the connected Astra DB database for relevant information. The retrieved data is then used to augment the input query, providing additional context to the language model. GPT-4 processes this augmented query and generates a response that incorporates the retrieved information, resulting in more accurate and context-aware answers.
